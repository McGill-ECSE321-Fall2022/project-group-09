The 15 most important requirements are listed [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2022/project-group-09/wiki/Requirements). The use-case diagrams along with descriptions for the six most important requirements are listed [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2022/project-group-09/wiki/Use-Case-Diagrams), and the use-case specifications for them are [here](https://github.com/McGill-ECSE321-Fall2022/project-group-09/wiki/Use-Case-Specifications).
